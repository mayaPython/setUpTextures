# setUpTextures
This is a photoshop action which sets up all your textures for the Unreal Engine. It works seamlessly with Soulburn Scripts.

You can download the Soulburn Scripts from Neil Blevin's website here:

This actions help you organise your textures and save them out with the correct naming convention for Unreal

To use this: save your master texture as T_name.psd then you can save out diffuse, normal, gloss  and specular maps automatically.

Start with your diffuse map then run the action.
